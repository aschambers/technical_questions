  	<h1>HTML, CSS, JS Questions:</h1>
  	<p>
		1.	What is HTML? <br />
			HTML is the abreviated form of Hyper Text Markup Language which is the main markup language used for web pages. HTML elements are the basic building blocks of the internet. It's purpose is to let us communicate with the browser the meaning of the content that we wish to place on a webpage. 
		2.	Give an example of 3 HTML block elements. <br />
			Block elements will stack regardless of their width, and three examples are body, div, and p tags. 
		3.	Give an example of 3 HTML inline elements. <br />
			Inline elements flow from one line to the next, and three examples are img, span, and select tags.
		4.	What is the function of the (fieldset) tag in HTML? <br />
			The fieldset tag is used to group related elements in a form. It draws a box around related elements.
		5.	Name three new input types added in html5. <br />
			HTML5 added several new input types and three of them are color, date, and month.
		6.	Can you explain the client server model? <br />
			The client/server model of technology is one where there are tasks are divided between the providers of a service called the server, and the service requesters called the client. For example, someone might access their bank account online with a web browser (client) and initiate a request to the bank's web server (server).
		7.	What is Javascript? <br />
			Javascript is an object-oriented interpreted computer programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is also a s cripting lanuage that can communicate directly with the DOM. Because of this, javascript can add, remove, and modify HTML elements.
		8.	Where is Javascript interpreted? <br />
			Javascript is interpreted at run time on whatever browser you chose to use, which means that as soon as you load of your code on a web browser, javascript is then interpreted and loaded. Not all browsers interpret javascript the same way however but they do follow rules. They scan for keywords var and function, and follow hoisting rules. 
		9.	What is a Style Sheet? <br />
			A style sheet is what is used to give our html or front-end frameworks elements such as color, height, and other visual elements mostly commonly used as CSS or cascading style sheet. 
		10.	How can I include comments in my Style Sheet? <br />
			Comments in a style sheet can be including using /* */ where comments are within those tags.
		11.	How do I center block-elements? <br />
			To style a block-element, you can give an element a class or id and use margin in css to set that class or id to auto.
		12.	Which browsers support CSS? <br />
			IE 11, Firefox 26, Chrome 29, Opera 23, and Safari 6 all support CSS. 
		13.	Name three ways to define a color in CSS. <br />
			Three ways you can define a color in css is to HEX, the actual color name, or RGB.
		14.	Explain the difference between visibility: hidden; and display: none. <br />
			visibility of hidden will just hide the element, whereas display of none will not be available on the page and does not occupy any space like visibility of hidden does. Visibility hidden preserves space and display none does not. 
		15.	What is the difference between inline and inline-block? <br />
			Inline elements respect left and right margins but not top and bottom, and cannot have a width or set height. Inline-block elements on the other hand do respect top and bottom margins and padding, as well as height and width.
		16.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of the three methods of applying style to elements? <br />
			One major advantage of the first type of style sheet, the external style sheet, is you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file and doesn't clutter the main page or logic and is more advantageous for web apps. Internal style sheets are quick for modifying the style of a small 1 page web application but can clutter your page and decrease readability. Lastly, inline styles can be useful but should be used sparingly as they mix content with the presentation or look. 
		17.	Explain the DOM and how we interact with it in Javascript. <br />
			The DOM is the Document Object Module, which is created for a web page whenever it is loaded and is constructed as a tree of objects. Javascript uses the DOM to create dynamic content in HTML. Using javascript, you can change HTML elements or attributes on a page, change CSS styles, remove HTML elements and attributes, add new HTML elements and attributes, react to existing HTML events on a page, and create new HTML events on a page. 
		18.	What three common objects are used in our interaction with the DOM? <br />
			Three common objects used in our interaction with the DOM are the HTML elements, HTML attributes and text inside HTML elements. 
		19.	Name 3 new features added in CSS3, and steps we must take to ensure cross-browser support. <br />
			Three new features that were added in CSS3 are new selectors that let you chose DOM elements based on their attributes, Box Shadow, and Text Shadow. To ensure cross-browser support you can run parallel tests on multiple browsers, you can use a CSS reset due to web browsers not having the same defaults, and you can vendor prefixs or fallbacks.

  	<h1>General Web Development Questions:</h1>
  	<p>
  		1.	What development tools have you used? <br />
  			I've used many web development tools including Javascript libraries such as JQuery, Front-End Frameworks such as Bootstrap, package managers such as NPM and many more. 
		2.	What languages have you programmed in? <br />
			I've programmed in PHP, Python, Javascript and a little bit of Ruby, as well as Java and Visual Basic Advanced. 
		3.	Why use version control and how should we use it effectively? <br />
			Version control is much better for collaboration because everyone is able to work freely on a file at any time, without stepping on anyone elses toes. It is also very useful for backup or restoring previous versions as you can see what was changed at any given time period. 
		4.	Tell me about the most recent project you worked on. What were your responsibilities? <br />
			I've been working on a project shortly after graduation on an Agile Scrum team. Our responsibilities were to write code for the front-end admin dashboard to allow the user to make changes to the front-end such as upload an image or add text to a specific part of the website. We used Angular for the front-end which was incorporated with a Ruby on Rails backend.
		5.	How did your education help prepare you for this job? <br />
			I spent three-full months in an immersive program learning PHP, Python and MEAN where I was learning to code as much as 80 or more hours per week. I also have a CIS degree from CSU Stanislaus and learned some Java and Visual Basic Advanced.
		6.	Tell me about the project you are proudest of, and what your contribution was. <br />
			One of the projects I'm most proud of was an project written in Javascript which allowed the user to select a move and manipulate the DOM to use special effects of moves like you would be able to in Pokemon. I spent a lot of time learning how to do this using primarily Javascript. 
		7.	What constitutes a RESTful API? <br />
			An API that adheres to the principles of REST does not require the client to know anything about the structure of the API.Rather, the server needs to provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the service. An HTML form is an example of this: The server specifies the location of the resource, and the required fields.
		8.	If your server was taking 10 minutes to serve an image how would you debug that performance issue? <br />
			I would first check the image size, and possibly resize the image. 
		9.	What is the difference between a unit test and a functional/integration test? <br />
			A unit test, tests the smallest unit of functionality, typically a method/function and should be used to focus on a particular feature. This test should not call out into collaborators, access the network, hit the database, use the file system, spin up a thread, etc. They help prove that the smallest building blocks of your program function as intended before being put together. Integration tests build on unit tests by combining units of code and testing that the resulting combination functions correctly. The main advantage is that they will find bugs in your code that unit tests can't such as wiring bugs (instance of a class), environment bugs (it runs fine on my single-CPU machine but colleagues 4 core machine doesn't pass the tests). Functional tests check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification. 
		10.	What is a singleton design pattern and how would you use it? <br />
			A singleton design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This ensures that only one instance of the singleton class ever exists and provides global access to that instance. The instance would most likely be stored as a private static variable, which is created when the variable is initialized at some point before the static method is first called. 

		11.	If I were to build a web app that could find every prime number, and would send a text message every time it finds a prime, what technologies and design patterns would you use? <br />

		12.	Explain the project your proudest of: <br />
		a.	What technologies did you use and why? <br />
		b.	How did you architect/organize the app and why did you choose that method? <br />
		c.	Why did you choose the database you used? <br />
		d.	What were some challenges you faced? <br />
		e.	What would you do differently the next time around? <br />
		13.	Explain all of the http verbs and their functions. <br />
			The 5 HTTP verbs are POST (Create), GET (Read), PUT (Update/Replace), PATCH (Update/Modify), and DELETE (Delete). POST is most-often utilized to create new resources, and returns an HTTP status of 201 if successful. GET is used to read data only, and not to change it. They are safe in that they may be called upon without risk of data modification or corruption. PUT is used to update capabilities but can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. PATCH is used to modify capabilities and only needs to contain the changes to the resource. DELETE is used to delete a resource and are given an HTTP status of 200 if successful. 
		14.	Explain the different between an SQL and NoSQL database, and why you would use each. <br />
			SQL databases are relational databases that have a pre-defined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. SQL databases are ideal for storing data that is structured like names, addresses, contact numbers, etc. NoSQL queries are not as powerful as SQL queries because NoSQL lacks standerd interfaces necessary to carry out complex queries. SQL databases are more stable and offer stronger data integrity, whereas NoSQL will work, but aren't as stable in high-load situations and with more complex transactions. Since NoSQL handles hierarchical data better, its preferable when managing big data. 
		15.	What factors would go into your decision to use one language over another, one framework over another? <br />
			One huge factor that goes into choosing a framework is how compatible it is with mobile. Applications should be rapidly adaptable to change, and should scale easily. How are the response times of your framework? What are your developers skill sets? How will the site be hosted? Do you have to work with an existing code base? 
		16.	What are the advantages of using a front-end framework? How would you decide which one you need for your project? <br />
			Front-end frameworks are great because they promote modularity which means it's maintainable, scalable and readable. This makes it easier for developers to understand what is going on. There are also built in features like easy routing and controller assignment in Angular. There are also common libraries like an http service to make backend calls. Lastly, some frameworks collaborate well with other front-end frameworks such as Angular and Bootstrap, allowing for easy integration such as using Boostrap UI. 
			When deciding what front-end framework is best to use for your project, several factors come into play. 
			- How responsive is your front-end framework, and is it compatible with older browsers such as IE8. 
			- Is your front-end framework compatible with your desired CSS pre-processor such as SaSS or Less. 
			- Does your framework allow for easy customization, or easy to make your website different from other websites in appearance, do you care?
			- How scalable is your code? For example, with React, whenever your state changes, the components are re-rendered. 
			- How well does it perform? How optimal is it to render pages with a lot of dynamic content, how is the DOM manipulated?
			- Adoption with mobile? Is it easy to develop and app on mobile with your front-end framework. With React, the langauge is so similar to React Native (IOS and Android), that it is easier than other front-end frameworks to build an app from your codebase. 
			- How easy is it for developers to understand, React is more complex because it uses JSX.
			- Are libraries and such included? Angular has a lot of third party libraries included which means less to manage.
