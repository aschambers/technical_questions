  	<h1>HTML, CSS, JS Questions:</h1>
  	<p>
		1.	What is HTML? <br />
			HTML is the abreviated form of Hyper Text Markup Language which is the main markup language used for web pages. HTML elements are the basic building blocks of the internet. It's purpose is to let us communicate with the browser the meaning of the content that we wish to place on a webpage. 
		2.	Give an example of 3 HTML block elements. <br />
			Block elements will stack regardless of their width, and three examples are body, div, and p tags. 
		3.	Give an example of 3 HTML inline elements. <br />
			Inline elements flow from one line to the next, and three examples are img, span, and select tags.
		4.	What is the function of the (fieldset) tag in HTML? <br />
			The fieldset tag is used to group related elements in a form. It draws a box around related elements.
		5.	Name three new input types added in html5. <br />
			HTML5 added several new input types and three of them are color, date, and month.
		6.	Can you explain the client server model? <br />
			The client/server model of technology is one where there are tasks are divided between the providers of a service called the server, and the service requesters called the client. For example, someone might access their bank account online with a web browser (client) and initiate a request to the bank's web server (server).
		7.	What is Javascript? <br />
			Javascript is an object-oriented interpreted computer programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is also a s cripting lanuage that can communicate directly with the DOM. Because of this, javascript can add, remove, and modify HTML elements.
		8.	Where is Javascript interpreted? <br />
			Javascript is interpreted at run time on whatever browser you chose to use, which means that as soon as you load of your code on a web browser, javascript is then interpreted and loaded. Not all browsers interpret javascript the same way however but they do follow rules. They scan for keywords var and function, and follow hoisting rules. 
		9.	What is a Style Sheet? <br />
			A style sheet is what is used to give our html or front-end frameworks elements such as color, height, and other visual elements mostly commonly used as CSS or cascading style sheet. 
		10.	How can I include comments in my Style Sheet? <br />
			Comments in a style sheet can be including using /* */ where comments are within those tags.
		11.	How do I center block-elements? <br />
			To style a block-element, you can give an element a class or id and use margin in css to set that class or id to auto.
		12.	Which browsers support CSS? <br />
			IE 11, Firefox 26, Chrome 29, Opera 23, and Safari 6 all support CSS. 
		13.	Name three ways to define a color in CSS. <br />
			Three ways you can define a color in css is to HEX, the actual color name, or RGB.
		14.	Explain the difference between visibility: hidden; and display: none. <br />
			visibility of hidden will just hide the element, whereas display of none will not be available on the page and does not occupy any space like visibility of hidden does. Visibility hidden preserves space and display none does not. 
		15.	What is the difference between inline and inline-block? <br />
			Inline elements respect left and right margins but not top and bottom, and cannot have a width or set height. Inline-block elements on the other hand do respect top and bottom margins and padding, as well as height and width.
		16.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of the three methods of applying style to elements? <br />
			One major advantage of the first type of style sheet, the external style sheet, is you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file and doesn't clutter the main page or logic and is more advantageous for web apps. Internal style sheets are quick for modifying the style of a small 1 page web application but can clutter your page and decrease readability. Lastly, inline styles can be useful but should be used sparingly as they mix content with the presentation or look. 
		17.	Explain the DOM and how we interact with it in Javascript. <br />
			The DOM is the Document Object Module, which is created for a web page whenever it is loaded and is constructed as a tree of objects. Javascript uses the DOM to create dynamic content in HTML. Using javascript, you can change HTML elements or attributes on a page, change CSS styles, remove HTML elements and attributes, add new HTML elements and attributes, react to existing HTML events on a page, and create new HTML events on a page. 
		18.	What three common objects are used in our interaction with the DOM? <br />
			Three common objects used in our interaction with the DOM are the HTML elements, HTML attributes and text inside HTML elements. 
		19.	Name 3 new features added in CSS3, and steps we must take to ensure cross-browser support. <br />
			Three new features that were added in CSS3 are new selectors that let you chose DOM elements based on their attributes, Box Shadow, and Text Shadow. To ensure cross-browser support you can run parallel tests on multiple browsers, you can use a CSS reset due to web browsers not having the same defaults, and you can vendor prefixs or fallbacks. 
  	</p>
  	<h1>Python Questions:</h1>
  	<p>
  		1.	What is the statement that can be used in Python if a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action? <br />
 			You can use the pass statement, which is a no-operation/action statement in python. 
		2.	What is a python lambda and in what situation might you need to use one? <br />
			Python’s lambda is a tool for building functions (or more precisely, function objects). That means that Python has two tools for building functions: def and lambda. We don’t need lambda, and we could get along all right without it, but
			there are certain situations where it is convenient — it makes writing code a bit easier, and the written code a bit cleaner.
		3.	Name five Python modules in the standard library, and five non-standard Python modules. <br />
			There are int(), getattr(), map(), min(), and round() modules in the standard library. In the non-standard library, 
		4.	Walk through the steps of installing a third-party Python package or module. <br />
			You would use pip to install the package or module, and include it at the top of your file as an import. 
		5.	What is PEP 8? <br />
			PEP 8 is a style guide for python code. Conforming your Python code to PEP 8 is generally a good idea and helps make code more consistent when working on projects with other developers. 
		6.	What does the “with” statement do? <br />
			The ‘with‘ statement clarifies code that previously would use try/finally blocks to ensure that clean-up code is executed.
		7.	What is __init__.py? <br />
			The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable.
		8.	What is scope in python? <br />
			There are 4 basic scopes, the LEGB, for Local, Enclosing, Global and Built-in. In addition to those, there is a special scope, the class body, which does not comprise an enclosing scope for methods defined within the class; any assignments within the class body make the variable from there on be bound in the class body. Especially, no block statement, besides def and class, create a variable scope. In Python 2 the list comprehension does not create a variable scope, however in Python 3 the loop variable is created in a new scope.
		9.	Define a method in Python? <br />
			A method is a function that takes a class instance as its first parameter. Methods are members of classes. class C: def method(self, possibly, other, arguments): pass # do something here. As you wanted to know what it specifically means in Python, one can distinguish between bound and unbound methods.
		10.	Define self? <br />
			The first argument of every class method, including __init__, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the __init__ method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called.
		11.	Describe python usage in web programming? <br />
			Python is a dynamic, strongly typed, object oriented, multipurpose programming language, designed to be quick (to learn, to use, and to understand), and to enforce a clean and uniform syntax. You can use Python to create web applications on many levels of complexity. 
		12.	Explain the rules for local and global variables in python? <br />
			In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local. If a variable is ever assigned a new value inside the function, the variable is implicitly local, and you need to explicitly declare it as global.
		13.	How could I go about finding the methods or attributes of an object if I do not have access to the code that created it? <br />
			You can use the built in dir() function to get a list of all the attributes a module has. Also, you can use the hasattr(module_name, "attr_name") function to find out if a module has a specific attribute.
		14.	Define class? <br />
			Class in Python is like a blueprint for creating something. Once you've finished the blueprint, you can created instances of the class. 
		15.	Explain how Python is interpreted. <br />
			Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on PCs under MS-DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and OS/2.
		16.	Explain the different between a tuple and a list, and give at least one example of when one would want to use a tuple. <br />
			The key difference is that tuples are immutable. This means that you cannot change the values in a tuple once you have created it. So if you're going to need to change the values use a List. Benefits to tuples: Slight performance improvement. As a tuple is immutable it can be used as a key in a dictionary. If you can't change it neither can anyone else, which is to say you don't need to worry about any API functions etc. changing your tuple without being asked. 
		17.	Are double quotes or single quotes used for String representation in Python? <br />
			Python is clever; it'll use double quotes for strings that contain single quotes when generating the representation, to minimize escapes. Add a double quote in there as well and it'll revert back to single quotes and escape any single quotes contained. 
		18.	Does Python strongly support regular expressions? <br />
			Yes, regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. 
		19.	What is list comprehension in Python? <br />
			List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create list in Python. These lists have often the qualities of sets, but are not in all cases sets. Essentially, it is Python's way of implementing a well-known notation for sets as used by mathematicians. 
  	</p>
  	<h1>MEAN Questions:</h1>
  	<p>
  		1.	What are some benefits of client side rendering vs. back end rendering? <br />
  			With client side rendering, you can update the screen immediately when the user clicks, rather than wait for the server to be contacted and display it. You also run into less browser compatibility issues with client side rendering. 
		2.	Does every request need to be paired with a response? <br />
			Every request should be paired with a response so you know your request was successful, but is not required. 
		3.	MongoDB stores _________ ? <br />
			MongoDB stores objects in binary form called BSON.
		4.	What is JSON and what are some uses for it? <br />
			JSON is short for Javascript Object Notation, and is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. Loading data quickly and asynchronously is important, and JSON allows you to do that, and overcome cross-domain issues.  
		5.	What is ES6 and how does it relate to Javascript? <br />
			ES6 is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification. ECMAScript is the “proper” name for the language commonly referred to as JavaScript. You can use the keyword "let" to declare variables as well as var. While var results in a variable with the surrounding function as its scope, the scope of a variable declared using let is only the block it is in. This can make for cleaner code, resulting in fewer variables hanging around. There is another way to declare block-scoped variables as well. Many changes like this have changed how Javascript is written. 
		6.	True or False, one server only has one database? Explain. <br />
			False, you can have more than one database, but it is not recommended. You should only have one database per server, otherwise you can have performance issues, and may also encounter problems relating to maintenance, administration, upgrading your server, and concurrency. 
		7.	How do we run Javascript on the backend? <br />
			One way you can run Javascript on the backend is with Node, as it is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime.
		8.	Which is more secure, the client or the server? <br />
			One isn't more secure than the other, both have downsides with security methods that are chosen.  
		9.	In Javascript, strings are immutable, what does this mean? <br />
			This means you can't change the object yourself, but you can change the reference to the object. In other words, you can not change the current string, but you can return a new string. 
		10.	What kind of scoping does Javascript use to store variables? <br />
			In Javascript, variables that are declared within a Javascript function become local to that function. Local variables have local scope and can only be accessed within the function. Variables declared outside a function are global and can be accessed from anywhere. 
		11.	Name three different kinds of Javascript loops. <br /> 
			There is a FOR loop which loops through a set of code a specified number of times, a WHILE loop which loops through a set of code while a condition is true, and a DO/WHILE loop which is the same as a while loop, except it will execute a code block once, before checking if a condition is true and repeat as long as the condition is true. 
		12.	What can be stored in a JSON attribute? <br />
			You can store a number, string, boolean, array, object, or null as a JSON attribute. 
		13.	What is an IDE? <br />
			An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software. 
		14.	What’s the difference between a terminal and an IDE? <br />
			With a terminal, you can compile code written in a text editor of your choice, whereas an IDE is already integrated to be able to consolidate your code and write and test software all in one. 
		15.	What happens when you try to run alert(‘hello’) on Node? <br />
			Node will crash, because there is no alert function available outside the browser and is only a property of browser window objects. 
		16.	Imagine you’re looping through an array of a hundred elements. Why would that loop run slower on a browser than in Node? <br />
			In a web browser(Chrome), declaring a variable outside of any function scope makes it global and therefore binds to window object. As a result, running this code in a web browser requires repeatedly resolving the property within the heavily populated window namespace in each iteration of the loop. In Node.js however, declaring any variable outside of any function’s scope binds it only to the module scope (not the window object) which therefore makes it much easier and faster to resolve.
		17.	Explain garbage collection in Javascript. <br />
			When a block of memory (an object, say) is no longer reachable, it is eligible to be reclaimed. The DOM component is "garbage collected", as is the JScript component, which means that if you create an object within either component, and then lose track of that object, it will eventually be cleaned up.
		18.	Javascript is a true OOP language, true or false. Explain. <br />
			True. Unlike most object-oriented languages, JavaScript has no concept of classes, but prototypes. As such, it is indeed somewhat subjective whether to call it object-oriented or not.
		19.	How do you write class methods in Javascript? <br />
			There are many ways to write class methods in Javascript; you can use a constructor function, you can use prototypes, etc.
		20.	How do you instantiate a class in Javascript? <br />
			You can use a function to instantiate a class, you can use object literals and you can use a singleton (using a function to define a singleton object). 
		21.	Explain the var keyword. <br />
			The var keyword is used to declare a variable and initialize a value for it. Inside a function, it will create a local variable, outside a function it will be global. 
		22.	Explain ‘use strict’ in Javascript. <br />
			The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables. Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript. Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors. As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.
		23.	Explain when semicolons are required in Javascript. <br />
			Often our code will run fine without semi-colons, but semi-colons indicate the end of a statement as Javascript is interpreted line by line. Code blocks do not need semi-colons, with one exception, the function expression. Statements inside the code blocks do require a semi-colon. Anything with an = operator is an assignment, which needs a semi-colon.
		24.	In what places does the , character appear in Javascript? (hint, there are at least three) <br />
			The comma operator evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand. You can use the comma operator when you want to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. The most common usage of this operator is to supply multiple parameters in a for loop. Another example that one could make with comma operator is processing before returning. It can be used in an array, in a loop, and in a function.

  	<h1>General Web Development Questions:</h1>
  	<p>
  		1.	What development tools have you used? <br />
  			I've used many web development tools including Javascript libraries such as JQuery, Front-End Frameworks such as Bootstrap, package managers such as NPM and many more. 
		2.	What languages have you programmed in? <br />
			I've programmed in PHP, Python, Javascript and a little bit of Ruby, as well as Java and Visual Basic Advanced. 
		3.	Why use version control and how should we use it effectively? <br />
			Version control is much better for collaboration because everyone is able to work freely on a file at any time, without stepping on anyone elses toes. It is also very useful for backup or restoring previous versions as you can see what was changed at any given time period. 
		4.	Tell me about the most recent project you worked on. What were your responsibilities? <br />
			I've been working on a project shortly after graduation on an Agile Scrum team. Our responsibilities were to write code for the front-end admin dashboard to allow the user to make changes to the front-end such as upload an image or add text to a specific part of the website. We used Angular for the front-end which was incorporated with a Ruby on Rails backend.
		5.	How did your education help prepare you for this job? <br />
			I spent three-full months in an immersive program learning PHP, Python and MEAN where I was learning to code as much as 80 or more hours per week. I also have a CIS degree from CSU Stanislaus and learned some Java and Visual Basic Advanced.
		6.	Tell me about the project you are proudest of, and what your contribution was. <br />
			One of the projects I'm most proud of was an project written in Javascript which allowed the user to select a move and manipulate the DOM to use special effects of moves like you would be able to in Pokemon. I spent a lot of time learning how to do this using primarily Javascript. 
		7.	What constitutes a RESTful API? <br />
			An API that adheres to the principles of REST does not require the client to know anything about the structure of the API.Rather, the server needs to provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the service. An HTML form is an example of this: The server specifies the location of the resource, and the required fields.
		8.	If your server was taking 10 minutes to serve an image how would you debug that performance issue? <br />
			I would first check the image size, and possibly resize the image. 
		9.	What is the difference between a unit test and a functional/integration test? <br />
			A unit test, tests the smallest unit of functionality, typically a method/function and should be used to focus on a particular feature. This test should not call out into collaborators, access the network, hit the database, use the file system, spin up a thread, etc. They help prove that the smallest building blocks of your program function as intended before being put together. Integration tests build on unit tests by combining units of code and testing that the resulting combination functions correctly. The main advantage is that they will find bugs in your code that unit tests can't such as wiring bugs (instance of a class), environment bugs (it runs fine on my single-CPU machine but colleagues 4 core machine doesn't pass the tests). Functional tests check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification. 
		10.	What is a singleton design pattern and how would you use it? <br />
			A singleton design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This ensures that only one instance of the singleton class ever exists and provides global access to that instance. The instance would most likely be stored as a private static variable, which is created when the variable is initialized at some point before the static method is first called. 
		11.	If I were to build a web app that could find every prime number, and would send a text message every time it finds a prime, what technologies and design patterns would you use? <br />
			One of the technologies I would use would be twilio's API to be able to send the text message. If it were me, I would also use Javascript and write a program that would search through all of the numbers, and push prime numbers into an array that would be linked to the twilio api to be able to send a text message when it hits a prime number. 
		12.	Explain the project your proudest of: <br />
		a.	What technologies did you use and why? <br />
		b.	How did you architect/organize the app and why did you choose that method? <br />
		c.	Why did you choose the database you used? <br />
		d.	What were some challenges you faced? <br />
		e.	What would you do differently the next time around? <br />
		13.	Explain all of the http verbs and their functions. <br />
			The 5 HTTP verbs are POST (Create), GET (Read), PUT (Update/Replace), PATCH (Update/Modify), and DELETE (Delete). POST is most-often utilized to create new resources, and returns an HTTP status of 201 if successful. GET is used to read data only, and not to change it. They are safe in that they may be called upon without risk of data modification or corruption. PUT is used to update capabilities but can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. PATCH is used to modify capabilities and only needs to contain the changes to the resource. DELETE is used to delete a resource and are given an HTTP status of 200 if successful. 
		14.	Explain the different between an SQL and NoSQL database, and why you would use each. <br />
			SQL databases are relational databases that have a pre-defined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. SQL databases are ideal for storing data that is structured like names, addresses, contact numbers, etc. NoSQL queries are not as powerful as SQL queries because NoSQL lacks standerd interfaces necessary to carry out complex queries. SQL databases are more stable and offer stronger data integrity, whereas NoSQL will work, but aren't as stable in high-load situations and with more complex transactions. Since NoSQL handles hierarchical data better, its preferable when managing big data. 
		15.	What factors would go into your decision to use one language over another, one framework over another? <br />
			One huge factor that goes into choosing a framework is how compatible it is with mobile. Applications should be rapidly adaptable to change, and should scale easily. How are the response times of your framework? What are your developers skill sets? How will the site be hosted? Do you have to work with an existing code base? 
		16.	What are the advantages of using a front-end framework? How would you decide which one you need for your project? <br />
			Front-end frameworks are great because they promote modularity which means it's maintainable, scalable and readable. This makes it easier for developers to understand what is going on. There are also built in features like easy routing and controller assignment in Angular. There are also common libraries like an http service to make backend calls. Lastly, some frameworks collaborate well with other front-end frameworks such as Angular and Bootstrap, allowing for easy integration such as using Boostrap UI. 
			When deciding what front-end framework is best to use for your project, several factors come into play. 
			- How responsive is your front-end framework, and is it compatible with older browsers such as IE8. 
			- Is your front-end framework compatible with your desired CSS pre-processor such as SaSS or Less. 
			- Does your framework allow for easy customization, or easy to make your website different from other websites in appearance, do you care?
			- How scalable is your code? For example, with React, whenever your state changes, the components are re-rendered. 
			- How well does it perform? How optimal is it to render pages with a lot of dynamic content, how is the DOM manipulated?
			- Adoption with mobile? Is it easy to develop and app on mobile with your front-end framework. With React, the langauge is so similar to React Native (IOS and Android), that it is easier than other front-end frameworks to build an app from your codebase. 
			- How easy is it for developers to understand, React is more complex because it uses JSX.
			- Are libraries and such included? Angular has a lot of third party libraries included which means less to manage.
