  	<h1>HTML, CSS, JS Questions:</h1>
  	<p>
		1.	What is HTML? <br />
			HTML is the abreviated form of Hyper Text Markup Language which is the main markup language used for web pages. HTML elements are the basic building blocks of the internet. It's purpose is to let us communicate with the browser the meaning of the content that we wish to place on a webpage. 
		2.	Give an example of 3 HTML block elements. <br />
			Block elements will stack regardless of their width, and three examples are body, div, and p tags. 
		3.	Give an example of 3 HTML inline elements. <br />
			Inline elements flow from one line to the next, and three examples are img, span, and select tags.
		4.	What is the function of the (fieldset) tag in HTML? <br />
			The fieldset tag is used to group related elements in a form. It draws a box around related elements.
		5.	Name three new input types added in html5. <br />
			HTML5 added several new input types and three of them are color, date, and month.
		6.	Can you explain the client server model? <br />
			The client/server model of technology is one where there are tasks are divided between the providers of a service called the server, and the service requesters called the client. For example, someone might access their bank account online with a web browser (client) and initiate a request to the bank's web server (server).
		7.	What is Javascript? <br />
			Javascript is an object-oriented interpreted computer programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is also a s cripting lanuage that can communicate directly with the DOM. Because of this, javascript can add, remove, and modify HTML elements.
		8.	Where is Javascript interpreted? <br />
			Javascript is interpreted at run time on whatever browser you chose to use, which means that as soon as you load of your code on a web browser, javascript is then interpreted and loaded. Not all browsers interpret javascript the same way however but they do follow rules. They scan for keywords var and function, and follow hoisting rules. 
		9.	What is a Style Sheet? <br />
			A style sheet is what is used to give our html or front-end frameworks elements such as color, height, and other visual elements mostly commonly used as CSS or cascading style sheet. 
		10.	How can I include comments in my Style Sheet? <br />
			Comments in a style sheet can be including using /* */ where comments are within those tags.
		11.	How do I center block-elements? <br />
			To style a block-element, you can give an element a class or id and use margin in css to set that class or id to auto.
		12.	Which browsers support CSS? <br />
			IE 11, Firefox 26, Chrome 29, Opera 23, and Safari 6 all support CSS. 
		13.	Name three ways to define a color in CSS. <br />
			Three ways you can define a color in css is to HEX, the actual color name, or RGB.
		14.	Explain the difference between visibility: hidden; and display: none. <br />
			visibility of hidden will just hide the element, whereas display of none will not be available on the page and does not occupy any space like visibility of hidden does. Visibility hidden preserves space and display none does not. 
		15.	What is the difference between inline and inline-block? <br />
			Inline elements respect left and right margins but not top and bottom, and cannot have a width or set height. Inline-block elements on the other hand do respect top and bottom margins and padding, as well as height and width.
		16.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of the three methods of applying style to elements? <br />
			One major advantage of the first type of style sheet, the external style sheet, is you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file and doesn't clutter the main page or logic and is more advantageous for web apps. Internal style sheets are quick for modifying the style of a small 1 page web application but can clutter your page and decrease readability. Lastly, inline styles can be useful but should be used sparingly as they mix content with the presentation or look. 
		17.	Explain the DOM and how we interact with it in Javascript. <br />
			The DOM is the Document Object Module, which is created for a web page whenever it is loaded and is constructed as a tree of objects. Javascript uses the DOM to create dynamic content in HTML. Using javascript, you can change HTML elements or attributes on a page, change CSS styles, remove HTML elements and attributes, add new HTML elements and attributes, react to existing HTML events on a page, and create new HTML events on a page. 
		18.	What three common objects are used in our interaction with the DOM? <br />
			Three common objects used in our interaction with the DOM are the HTML elements, HTML attributes and text inside HTML elements. 
		19.	Name 3 new features added in CSS3, and steps we must take to ensure cross-browser support. <br />
			Three new features that were added in CSS3 are new selectors that let you chose DOM elements based on their attributes, Box Shadow, and Text Shadow. To ensure cross-browser support you can run parallel tests on multiple browsers, you can use a CSS reset due to web browsers not having the same defaults, and you can vendor prefixs or fallbacks.
